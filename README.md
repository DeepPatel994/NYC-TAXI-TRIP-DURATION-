# NYC-TAXI-TRIP-DURATION-
The New York City Taxi Fare prediction challenge, currently running on Kaggle, is a supervised regression machine learning task. Given pickup and dropoff locations, the pickup timestamp, and the passenger count, the objective is to predict the fare of the taxi ride. Like most competitions, this problem isn’t 100% reflective of those in industry .


it does present a realistic dataset and task on which we can hone our machine learning skills.
To solve this problem, we’ll follow a standard data science pipeline plan of attack:
Understand the problem and data
Data exploration / data cleaning
Feature engineering / feature selection
Model evaluation and selection
Model optimization
Interpretation of results and predictions
